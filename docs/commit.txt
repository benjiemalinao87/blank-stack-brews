Real-time Board Updates Fix

Key details and improvements:
- Enhanced board refresh mechanism for cross-board contact moves
- Added immediate state updates for both source and target boards
- Implemented double refresh event dispatch for better sync
- Added explicit fetchBoardContacts call for source board
- Improved event listener to handle all board refresh events

Lessons Learned:
- Always update both source and target states in cross-board operations
- Use event system for real-time updates across components
- Implement proper state synchronization between boards
- Double-check data consistency after state updates
- Consider all affected components when handling updates
