I think we may need another table to save how many sequence with column of date and time of scheduled sending and broadcast type (sms, or email or sms&email) and of course the contents of the broadcast. The the day sequence should have their ow scheduled time like day 1 is scheduled at 04-10-2025.

Schedule Your Broadcast

Both the Send immediately and Schedule for later should be using > queue-services endpoint. See sample. In the tracking tab, show the numbers :

Recipients
Delivered

Delivery Status:
Delivered - delivery status based on Twilio data
Failed - delivery status based on Twilio data
Pending - any scheduled contacts to be sent 


Please help in designing what table schema to be used for tracking above.
